# Heart-Disease-Risk-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project implements an efficient machine learning pipeline to predict heart disease risk using statistical analysis, data visualization, and supervised learning. By analyzing medical features such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG results, the model identifies patients at high risk, supporting early detection
